Thank you for participating in the Cheryl's Puzzle experiment! 

For data keeping, please fill in the following form detailing your demographic data, background knowledge and general opinion of the present study.
You will be asked to fill in your name and email address: this information will be stored separately from the puzzle answers and will only be
accessed in special cases (e.g. if payment did not go through successfully). Importantly, your answers to the puzzles will not be traced back to you!

Please fill in the entire form - it should not take longer than 5 minutes. After filling in the form, you are free to leave.
