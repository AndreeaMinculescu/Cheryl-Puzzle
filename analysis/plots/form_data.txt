Strategy: ['I wrote down the perspective that was not given yet, for example a temperature and the corresponding sizes, and reason from there using the conversation provided'
 'no strategy'
 'write down the different possible combinations and depending on what the dialogue between both characters showed, make the decision.'
 'i tried to first see what each of themknew and then put it into relation to each other'
 'I tried eliminating options based on the dialogue of the two friends. The most difficult parts were at the puzzles where the phrases were : Ï know that you know that I don\'t know". I got lost in the meaning behind them '
 'Mainly, i found it helpful to immediately write down what I though was the most important pieces of information from the text so that i did not need to keep looking back at the text to search for them again.'
 'I tried finding a pattern but for every new puzzle I did not find a way to solve it. I was trying to find a factor tat was standing alone and tat would be te only option ten. it did not work for me.'
 'I tried to see which combinations matched like you can get to know the answer by just colou or location, if not then it is something else'
 "Eliminated the options that weren't possible and went from there. Other than that, not much of a strategy; just tried to reason my answers."
 'Identify the options and then look at what is possible'
 'I wrote down all possible options and using the dialogue tried to eliminate answers until I reached a final one.'
 'first didnt have one and didnt know answer, hen started seeing what types were repeated and which were not, depending on that and each persons comment I could tell what it was. The last this didnt work so I didnt know the answer'
 'with the use of tables '
 'I tabulated the data and cross-checked it with the descriptions given by albert and benard'
 'I created a matrix ' 'no strategy'
 'I Looked at who got what kind of information, then i tried to see if i could already rule out some answers by looking at the conversation between albert and bernard. then based on which item was only occuring once of more times i tried to solve/guess the anwer. I did not get an answer for every problem. tried my best:)'
 'I tried to look at limting cases where knowing only one part of the case would allow you to deduce the otherside based on the fact that it is limiting only in one-side.'
 'try to narrow down the options, didnt understand how to get to the answer at first but later i saw multiple ways to narrow down the options even more looking at the conversations they had between them. '
 'I try to understand what follows directly from the first statement given by either Albert or Bernard. This information allows me to discard certain options, leading to only one possible solutions, confirmed by the implications from the second statement.'
 'If one charater knew the answer without talking to the other character, the answer had to have one unique trait (for example: only one hairstyle had the color blue). Otherwise I counted how many times the first character used the word know and counted down from the top of the list for their specific trait. However, at the begnning of the puzzles, I counted how many words the character said in general.'
 'I wrote down on the piece of paper every possibility and went one by one discarding them if they led to any kind of contradiction with the arguments.'
 "I wanted to create an alogithm in my mind but I couldn't really follow ny train of thught. I started trying to do it more intuitiely but it obviously ccomes down to an algorithm which discards variables and takes into account repetition and the initial and final conditions. "
 'Noted down all relevant information; noted down (or mentally considered) statements given; used process of elimination to figure out what could NOT be true based on each statement. Started with the first statement in any chain(?) of assertations. Physically crossed out eliminated options. My strategy did not evolve much with practice - I noticed some puzzles repeated prior situations, but since my previous approach had worked before, I just repeated it.'
 'I think writing down heped a lot, since i could cross things out. At some point i think i got more used to the type of questioning and so i could cross things off more easily.'
 'I chose to write down all the information Cheryl gave, as well as the number of times each possible state (e.g. temperature or type of toy), and what she told to each of the guys. Then I just worked out the statements: if it initially sounded confusing (i know that you know that I know), I would discard certain possiblities starting by the shortest of statements, for example: if Bernard says that he knows that A knows that B knows something, I would start with the last part: B knows something: why could he know that?'
 'Probability and understanding the conversation. Not always was helpful but there were few cases that I realized you can find the asnwer right away.'
 'Writing down the two types of variables in little tree tdiagrams and tried to eliminate the options based on the information given '
 'At first i was really confused but after i got the hang of it (towards the end), I could easily tell the odd one out by taking out the outlier from the first remark stated by the first boy. I.e. if said i know you dont know then it has to appear multiple times, etc.'
 'wrote down options and how many times they were occured (did that starting with pussle 2 and continued with every other puzzle)'
 'I jst follow the meaning of the sentences so arrivvig to the same conclusion but I do not really understand the puzzle.'
 'probability'
 'had a graphical representation of the differtent possible combinations and deduced the solution from that'
 'I worke out what they said step by step and removed cases along the way, following logic.'
 'I had a look at who ended up knowing the solutions to her riddles and then wrote down the possibilities and then started cutting wrong or overlapping ideas out.'
 'Discarding all the options that one of them could know that would make no sense for the puzzle, and the only evolution was that I stopped writing it down '
 "I slightly learned after that the options given giveaway some clue for the answer,  but you have to read carefully and piece all the information together to make it makesense. Thus, making it's possible to eliminate incorrect answer, and narrowdown the correct answer. Although, at the beginning I feels lost on how to figure it out."
 'In all the questions it was given the solution because Cheryl always gave one of the boys one part of the answer and the other one the other part. However they never said anything in their conversation thats why I couldnt solve it. '
 'First i crossed out items that could not be it, based on the first answer(so for example if i knew that Albert did not know what toy it was if he knew the posiiton than I would cross out the positions that had only one toy).'
 'I draw a table with the category 1 and the category 2. Then based on th the statements they made I could eliminate choices until there was one clear'
 'Made a grid and used process of elimination'
 'My strategy was based on the number of knows each person gave. I thought about my strategy after the second puzzle. '
 'analysng manly the conversation after and making a "table of what ït could be'
 'At firsti tried solving them in my head, but when the number of options increased, I had to use a paper. I drew a matrix of all the possible options so that i can see quickly which ones i can immediately eliminate.'
 'I listed all the options and deduced what the options were were either albert or bernard would know immediately. If there was an exclusion, sometimes it was clear what the right answer was but often not enough was eliminated to deduce this.'
 'i tried to tink of wic person knew te answer and then looked at te options '
 'First, I had to see what was repeate. If one of the boys immeditally knew the answer, then the solution could not be repeated. Next, I had to think about if one of the boys knew, after the other one did not. I then used process of elimination to find the correct solution. However, I think I sometimes lacked the obvious way of eliminating solutions. '
 'i made tables in which the data previously in columns was now in rows. Helped me visualise the information. This i developed after the first game. In the 4th and 5th i also did some if cases evaluation to make sure it made sense'
 'Eliminating main categories (i.e. month, location) that had exactly the same suboptions, as it would not be possible to know the answer. After that, following some logic specific to the problem, sometimes by elimination/trial-and-error.']
