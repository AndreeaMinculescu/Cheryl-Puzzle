Welcome to the Cheryl's Puzzle Experiment!;


IMPORTANT: Before continuing, make sure you have already signed the informed consent form.;


Please read the instructions below carefully and make sure you understand them before starting the experiment. You have 45 minutes to solve up to 8 puzzles, after which the experiment will automatically end. There is no time limit for individual puzzles, so we strongly recommend taking your time to think through the information provided and correctly solve as many puzzles as you can within the time limit.;


Hint: We strongly encourage you to use the paper and pen provided to take notes while solving the puzzles. You were provided with one piece of paper per puzzle. This is indicated through numbers in the upper left corner of the page, such that number 1 corresponds to the first puzzle, number 2 corresponds to the second puzzle, etc. Please try to keep the order in mind: take notes for a puzzle only on the piece of paper designated for that puzzle. Once you finish solving a puzzle, discard the piece of paper (put it inside the envelope provided). You are NOT allowed to look at your solution for previous puzzles!;


You will receive 7.5 EUR for completing the entire experiment.  It is possible to earn an additional 2.5 EUR bonus: after completing the experiment, one of the eight puzzles will be randomly selected and the bonus will be applied if your answer to that puzzle is correct. Thus, the chance of earning bonus money strongly depends on understanding the rules and seriously attempting to solve ALL puzzles.;


Next, you will be led through the instructions and some comprehension questions.
